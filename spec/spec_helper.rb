  # No registry reset — let has_typed_eav registrations from

  # Scope-handling metadata contract:
  #
  #   :scoping  - "I manage scope explicitly, don't wrap me." These specs
  #               drive `with_scope` / `unscoped` / resolver config themselves
  #               and must run with a clean ambient state.
  #   :unscoped - "Wrap me in `TypedEAV.unscoped` so the fail-closed default
  #               on scoped models (e.g. Contact with `scope_method: :tenant_id`)
  #               doesn't raise when the example calls class-level query
  #               methods without setting up a scope."
  #
  # Everything else runs as-is. Previously this block wrapped every example
  # in `unscoped` by default, which masked scoped+global name-collision bugs
  # in the class-level query path — opt-in is the safer contract.
