# Regression: ambient scope leaked into models that never opted into scoping.
#
# Before the fix, `typed_field_definitions` on an un-scoped host (e.g. Product,
# which declares `has_typed_eav` without `scope_method:`) would consult
# `TypedEAV.current_scope` and, inside a `with_scope` block, return the
# union of tenant-scoped fields + globals. That's wrong on two counts:
#   1. Product has no per-instance scope accessor, so
#      `Value#validate_field_scope_matches_entity` rejects any attempt to
#      actually attach those scoped fields — forms/admin would silently fail.
#   2. A model that never opted into tenancy shouldn't see cross-model
#      ambient state.
#
# The fix short-circuits in `resolve_scope` when `typed_eav_scope_method`
# is not set, returning nil (globals-only). Explicit `scope:` overrides and
# `TypedEAV.unscoped { }` remain fully functional. Scoped models
# (Contact) are unchanged.
