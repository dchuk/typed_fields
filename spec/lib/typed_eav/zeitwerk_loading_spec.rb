# Regression coverage for the T1.1 split of field/types.rb into one file
# per class. Before the split, an engine initializer explicitly loaded
# types.rb on every reload because Zeitwerk's 1:1 file/constant rule
# couldn't be satisfied. Now that Zeitwerk handles each class natively,
# we assert the descendants are all discoverable after a cold boot AND
# after an explicit reload, so nothing regresses silently if a future
# change re-introduces the multi-class-per-file pattern.
